# TextWatchES Weather


For Time Round only
--------------------

Por fin en español! TextWatch ES + Weather displays the time in natural language (Spanish-Castilian) and display the weather condition and temperature (in C or F). 

Based primarly on [DC TextWatch Deluxe](https://github.com/wackyneighbor/DC_Text_Watch_Deluxe) by [wackyneighbor](https://github.com/wackyneighbor) I evolved it to fit my own preferences:
  * Simple
  * Weather Added
  * Spanish only
  

Devs Help
--------------------
I am not planning on give continuity to this project, but if anyone would like to modify the code (translations and enhacements) I just tag the lines of the code that should be somehow modified with the tag TagDev. Summary of enhacements:
  * Translation for other languages
  * Improve the response from the Config (developed under Pebble Clay). Units updates after the main screen of the watch is restarted, not after saving settings.
  * Improve the customization: More weather providers (Yahoo based on this app)
